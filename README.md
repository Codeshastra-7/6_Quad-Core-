Lost Treasure
A lost and found website which can be used by two parties, the one finding the objects can take pictures and upload them while the other party can search for it.

Lots of people lose their valuable
belongings at stations, bus stops, and
at various places in the city. When we
find hold of such lost items, we are
clueless as to what steps should be
taken to help to deliver the lost item
to the right person.

Uploading images on the dedicated server was tough as working with node.js along with multer can be a curve. Handling multiple queries that take a lot of time made me go down the route of promises in java script. The time limit of 24 hours was tough as for front end we were usign 3js rendering. For verifying the item is going to the correct person, we had to use similarites between the descriptions provided by the founder and the finder. This was done with the help of similarites and similies libraries find in the npm packages. The login was barebone and requires more work in the future
